by the way the api.js isnt what the websocket is being hosted on because i made it a part of a express thing but my ip is in the file and i'm not showing that so yeah shame
although if you were to host it on api.js then you would be good locally but not with da other people

thank you to corbie for fixing the api.js (my version :trollface:) wow
