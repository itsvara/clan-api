# clan-api

### ðŸ¥¶ðŸ¥¶ðŸ¥¶ðŸ¥¶
shows details of a clash of clans clan of your choice

## https://varanox.xyz/clan-api/

### note: the .css and .js files dont actually do anything, they are just there to easily read the code. (for some reason css and js in files break for me and i can only use their corresponding tags in html :))

### another note: The api.js file only hosts locally. You will have to change the js in the index.html file to connect to your websocket server or else it will connect to varanox.xyz.

thank you to corbie for fixing the api.js (my version :trollface:)
